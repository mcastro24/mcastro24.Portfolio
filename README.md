# mcastro24.Portfolio
This is the portfolio homework assignment
After some time of working on it I was able to link everything together, when I last checked the page was functioning normally and I don't see any urgent problems
The only issue left was probably the pictures, they may or may not be able to load in but I was able to put in a alt tag to help it out a bit.

 UPDATE~
 I added what needed to be added for the homework, additionally I added a folder to my repo to make it look much more cleaner than it did before.
 I understand that my portfolio is not that flashy, I just don't know what to color or add on, if you can give any reccomendations I will take them to heart.
 I was able to plug in all of my accounts like github and my linkedin successfully. (The previous person who looked at my repo made reccomendations that really helped!)
 
 P.S If you are reading this I was recently told about plagiarism on my account, I am saying it here for the record that I am using previously used html because I have taken this course previously, this message was mostly for brian since I had to talk to peter about this and this is exactly what he told me to say.
