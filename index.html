          <p>My name is Marcos Castro and I am a student at San Diego City College additionally I also attend a coding boot camp in hopes of learning
            web development. I like to read, travel, and watch movies on my spare time because I find them to be very enjoyable activities. Also currently
            I am trying to get a job at Kohls, in hopes of landing a part time job so I can have some money on the side since I am pretty broke 
            right now. If you have any questions please feel free to email me. Also please take a look at my portfolio for pictures from my trips.
